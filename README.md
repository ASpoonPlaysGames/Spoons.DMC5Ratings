This mod implements the Ratings system from Devil May Cry 5! Its still unfinished and doesn't have many of the songs. Why? Well tbh its a huge pain to add the songs to the system, and I also ran out of unused music audio events.

Yes I'll get around to making the various songs, primarily the 4 battle themes

**This mod requires both ModSettings and ClientKillCommand**
